# Phishing 4 Fun

## What is this?
Phishing 4 Fun is an application programmed as a group (Kathryn, Aidan & Jared) for a hackathon hosted by CoderAcademy. The idea for this application was an idle game where you could fish and receive either junk or a fish of varying rarity. You would then use the currency obtained by collecting said fish to purchase upgrades. This was completed in a span of 36 hours.


## Tech stack use
Phishing 4 Fun was programmed using React.js, css and styled components.

## Future Works
We plan on continuing this project with a v2 that holds other games and more indepth works. We also plan to use Material UI to it's fullest to grow and build this to a long term application.
